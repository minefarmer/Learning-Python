""" ELIF STATEMENTS
an elif statement is kind of like a bridge or a combinition of one else statement and an if statement
elif statements are kind of like multipule if statements
elif statements are used to check for multipule expresions that are true in my program, so they check for several conditions that are True and if one of them is true it executes the first one it finds and then ignores the rest, it then executes the block of code inside that block and if the condition is not True it doesn't do anything

Used to check multiple expressions for True conditions
only executes a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates as TRUE
