"""OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Type of programming that breaks things into objects that interacts with each other.

Opjects are created from class.
    a class is like a template from which objects are created in OOP.

Object Oriented Programming encourages code reuse through "Don't Repeat Yourself" concept.




WHAT IS AN OBJECT
An object can be an entity or anything in my program, like a noun.

Examples of real world object are houses, cars, etc, bank accounts, etc,




WHAT IS A CLASS
A class is a blueprint(template) for creating objects.

Classes can have properties(attributes) which are like variable that store data.

Classes can also have behsviours(methods). These are like functions.

I can create many unique objects from a single class.




THIS IS A TEMPLATE
Class (car)  # can have: 
                        Attributes               Methods
                            Color                   Start()
                            Engine                  Stop()
                            Door                    Reverse()
                            Brand                   Accelerate()
                            
       From this template I can create objects
