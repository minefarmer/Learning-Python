'''Functions
Functions are pieces(block) of code that does something
They are reusable
They execte or run when called by thier name
They can have parameters(variables) and arguments(values)
They can return data as a result
There are built-in functions. Example print()
I can also create my own custom functions

Descriptive nam,es
Same naming rules as variables

def function_name():
    print("Hello World!")

def sum(x,y):
    print(x + y)

# the function does nothing untill the function is activated.  *** also known as: running, executing, invoking

# I can call a function by it's  name and add parenthesis

# Any parameters or arguments are placed inside the parenthesis

sum(4,5)   # calls the function and executes the function

"""Parameter Vs Argument
A Parameter is a variable defined inside a function's parentheses

An argument is the actual value passed(give)the function when it i called
