''' Binary   ***  sec 4 lesson 42
Binary is the language that computers ubderstand.
Binary consists of 0's and 1's.
Binary is a system of countingdatetime A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: ()Binary is also known as base 2.

What you need to do when you convert the numbers to binary you have to keep dividing that number in half until I get to one and I ignore the remainders as you go along.

dividing 13
    13 / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1
the numbers are reversed
    13  6  3  1  becomes   1  3  6  13
the binary format then assigns a one to odd nimbers and a zero to even numbersdatetime A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: ()
13 then becomes =  1  3  6  13
the way binary format works is that it assigns one to odd numbers and zero to even numbersdatetime A combination of a date and a time.
13 then becomes =  1  1  9  1

converting a binary number into a normal number.
a binary number =  1  0  0  1  0
first I need to find the expotential value.
a binary number =       1       0       0       1       0
raise to the power      2(4)    2(3)    2(2)    2(1)    2(0)     
[Ignore zeros]
                      2x2x2x2         +        2x1      =     16+2  = 18

                      
           Converting Binary decimal to Number Decimal
           
             1  1  0  0  .  1  0    1           ====    12.625
