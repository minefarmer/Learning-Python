"""HANDLING EXCEPTIONS
It's a good practice to specify how your program handles exceptions when they occur.
If I do not specify how my program will handle exceptions -- python will use it's own built-in methods  --  they are not always user friendly.
Errors can be handled or caught by embedding my code in try and exception blocks.
For every try block there has to be a least one except block.
The handlers for the specific errors are placed inside the except block.
The default Python handler is called if no handler is specified.


KEYWORDS USED IN HANDLING EXCEPTIONS
try block: Lets me test a block of code for errors.
except block: Lets me specify how to handle the errors.
finally block: Lets me specify what code to execute regradless of what happens in try and except block.
else block: Lets me specify what code to execute if no exception errors occurs. This is optionally used.




SYNTAX FOR HANDLING EXCEPTIONS
try:
    code to test for errors
    
except:
    code to handle errors
    
finally:
    code to execute reguardless of errors

else:
    code to execute if there are no errors
